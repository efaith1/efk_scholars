    <h1>My Journey as a Kenyan Student in America</h1>

    <div class="blog-post">
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Hello! My name is Mary Njoroge, and I’m a proud Kenyan studying in the United States. I’m currently pursuing a degree in Computer Science at a liberal arts college in Pennsylvania. My journey from Nairobi to the U.S. has been a whirlwind of growth, learning, and exciting challenges, and I want to share my story with you.</p>

        <h2>Adjusting to a New Environment</h2>
        <p>Moving to the United States for college was both thrilling and intimidating. Everything was different—the weather (hello, snow!), the food, and even the way people interact. I remember my first winter feeling like a scene from a movie, but I also quickly learned how much I missed the warmth of home, both literally and figuratively.</p>
        <p>Despite the initial culture shock, I found comfort in the campus community. Joining international student groups and attending cultural events helped me meet other students who shared similar experiences.</p>

        <h2>Academic Challenges and Growth</h2>
        <p>The American education system was a big shift from what I was used to. Classes were more interactive, with lots of group discussions and participation. I initially felt nervous about speaking up, but my professors encouraged me to share my unique perspective as a Kenyan student. Over time, I grew more confident and found my voice.</p>
        <p>Balancing academics with extracurricular activities was another challenge, but it also taught me time management and discipline. I even joined the African Students Association, which gave me a platform to celebrate my culture while making lifelong friends.</p>

        <h2>Life Lessons and Opportunities</h2>
        <p>One of the most rewarding aspects of studying in the U.S. has been the exposure to endless opportunities. I’ve interned at tech companies, attended global conferences, and even started a mentorship program for high school students in Kenya.</p>
        <p>This journey has taught me resilience, adaptability, and the importance of staying true to my roots while embracing new experiences.</p>

        <h2>Advice for Future Students</h2>
        <p>For other Kenyan students considering studying in America, my advice is simple: be prepared, stay curious, and don’t be afraid to ask for help. The application process can be daunting, but organizations like EFK Scholars can guide you through it. Once you’re here, immerse yourself in the experience—join clubs, build relationships, and take every opportunity to grow.</p>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>Being a Kenyan student in America has been a life-changing experience. It’s not always easy, but the challenges have made me stronger and more determined to achieve my dreams. I hope my story inspires you to chase your goals and believe in the power of your unique journey.</p>
