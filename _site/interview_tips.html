    <h1>Interview Tips</h1>

    <div class="content">
        <h2>Why Interviews Matter</h2>
        <p>Interviews give colleges and scholarship committees a chance to learn more about you beyond your application. It’s your opportunity to showcase your personality, goals, and what makes you a great fit.</p>

        <h2>Top Tips for Interview Success</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Research the Institution:</strong> Learn about the college or organization, including its mission, programs, and recent achievements, so you can tailor your responses.</li>
            <li><strong>Practice Common Questions:</strong> Prepare answers to common questions such as "Tell me about yourself" or "Why are you interested in this college/scholarship?"</li>
            <li><strong>Highlight Your Strengths:</strong> Be ready to discuss your achievements, skills, and experiences that align with the institution's values.</li>
            <li><strong>Prepare Your Questions:</strong> Ask thoughtful questions about the program, campus life, or opportunities. This shows genuine interest.</li>
            <li><strong>Dress Professionally:</strong> Choose appropriate attire that reflects respect for the interviewer and the opportunity.</li>
            <li><strong>Be Confident and Authentic:</strong> Speak clearly, make eye contact, and be yourself. Authenticity leaves a lasting impression.</li>
            <li><strong>Practice Active Listening:</strong> Pay attention to the questions and respond thoughtfully. Don’t be afraid to ask for clarification if needed.</li>
            <li><strong>Follow Up:</strong> Send a thank-you email after the interview to express gratitude and reinforce your interest.</li>
        </ul>
